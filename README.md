# Template Gulp
#### Template Gulp Framework built with HTML5 / CSS3 / JS

---

## Setup

Install front-end dependencies with NPM:

```
npm install
```

## Running

There are two tasks that need to be run separately. It's recommended to do this via tabs in Terminal, so that every tab related this project is within one window.

Start the Gulp default task, watching for SASS / JS / Nunjuck changes:

```
gulp --env=development
```

Run the local web server, which opens up a `livereload` supported browser instance on `localhost:3000`:

```
gulp
```

## Packaging

Run this command to package:

```
npm run package
```
